Lines 10-17, make clientsByName into a function which returns something that you can immediately run map on

Lines 12-17, current pattern - declare collection, ... return collection.  Can make lines 12-17 one line

General

Make separate file with helper functions and put into require, abstract it out

Search by name and search by state would have two functions, and that would pass things to the abstract function
